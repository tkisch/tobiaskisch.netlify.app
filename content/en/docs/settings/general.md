### Title 

The title field holds the title of the website. This is used in the SEO title of the page and in the footer if you choose not to use a logo there.

### Description

The description is used for the meta description (SEO field) when the page has no (other) content.

### Favicon image

A website is not complete without a nice favicon image (shown in the address bar of your browser). Use an SVG image for the best result.

### Contact

The contact data for the contact buttons and the preheader are stored under 'contact' in a 'phone' and 'email' variable.

### Custom cursor

You can choose to use a custom cursor by setting this boolean to true or false.
